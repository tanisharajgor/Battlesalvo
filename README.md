### BattleSalvo - A twist on the classic Battleship, with automated strategy and tournament server-side support. ðŸš¢

Developed as part of an Object-Oriented Design (OOD) project, BattleSalvo consists of two interconnected components that together build on each other. I worked with MVC and SOLID design principles, remote interaction protocols, server-client communication with JSON, unit/integration testing, and AI game strategy.

Part 1 - single-player version of BattleSalvo against a created AI, using deduction, logic, and a bit of wizardry on the command line.

Part 2 - refactor and extend for server-client communication using the Proxy Design pattern, streamline program architecture, enhance AI, and conduct testing. 

Now, as various AIs set sail in strategic showdowns, they'll battle it out to determine who truly reigns supreme over the digital seas!
